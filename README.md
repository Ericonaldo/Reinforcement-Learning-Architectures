# Reinforcement-Learning-Architectures
Collections of powerful RL architectures with brief introductions.

Legend:

Base Language: The source language.

API Language: The language to be called.

Environment: The RL environment contatined, "-" means no environment is impletmented, but most can deal with OpenAI gym API.

Algorithm: The RL algorithm contatined, "-" means no algorithm is impletmented.

Remarks: The target of this repository.
